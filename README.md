# Projekt_klientprogrammering
This is the project for the klientprogrammering course.
The "" between command lines used in the quide is just to show that it is a command line. Dont use the "" inside the terminal. 

#Getting started
An github account is needed.
Open the Terminal
Use the command: "git" to see all the commands.

We only have to do this once

1. First we will add this repository to a selected place on your computer. We will do this by using the cd commands in the terminal to navigste to our wanted location for the respository. If you are using windows use: "dir" to show all the folders and files inside the selected directory, the command: "ls" will do the same for mac. Use the command: "cd.." to go up a directory, or navigate using:  "cd name of directory". When you are inside the directory where you want to put the respository use: "git clone https://github.com/GlorifiedHam/Projekt_klientprogrammering.git". This will make a copy of the respository on your computer.

2. Use "cd Projekt_klientprogrammering" to move from the selected directory in to the newly made Project_klientprogrammering.

3. We can see what it contains using "dir" for windows or "ls" for mac.

# Getting the updated version of the respository and to be able to update it.
Open the Terminal.
These commands will only work inside the github repository.

4. "Git status" will show what is diffrent from your computer and github.

5. "git add Name of the file" will add the file/ changes into our commit que. We can also use "git add A" or "git add ." which will add every thing changed into our commit que. If we use "git status " after using a git add we will see that there is a change to be commited.

6. "git commit -m" Here we will add a message, the quotes are needed! " " Now the changes are commited but only located in your machine. If you try to use git commit with out a message use: esc then ":wq". 

7. "git"push" Pushes the changes to github.

8. "git pull" Gives the latest version of the github repository.
