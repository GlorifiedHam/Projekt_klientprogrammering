# Projekt_klientprogrammering
This is the project for the klientprogrammering course.

#Getting started
Open the Terminal

Only have to do this once

1. First we will add this repository to a selected place on your computer. We will do this by using the cd commands in the terminal to navigste to our wanted location for the respository. If you are using windows use: "dir" to show all the folders and files inside the selected directory, the command: "ls" will do the same for mac. Use the command: "cd.." to go up a directory, or navigate using:  "cd name of directory". When you are inside the directory where you want to put the respository use: "git clone https://github.com/GlorifiedHam/Projekt_klientprogrammering.git". This will make a copy of the respository on your computer.

2. Use "cd Projekt_klientprogrammering" to move from the selected directory in to the newly made Projectklientprogrammering.

3. Now we can look what it contains using "dir" for windows or "ls" for mac.

# Getting the updated version of the respository and to be able to update it.
Open the Terminal
These commands will only work when we are in the github repository

4. "Git status" will show what is diffrent from your computer and github

5. "git add Name of the file"  will add the file/ changes into our git project. If we use "git status " after using a git add we will see that there is a change to be commited

6. "git commit -m"here we will add the message the quotes are needed!" " Now the changes are commited but loced into your machine.

7. "git"push" Will push the changes to github

8. "git pull" Will give the latest updated version of items inside the github repository
